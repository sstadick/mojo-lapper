"""GPU kernels for parallel binary search operations on interval data.

This module provides GPU kernel implementations of binary search algorithms optimized
for massively parallel interval overlap detection. The kernels leverage GPU thread
parallelism to process thousands of search queries simultaneously.

Key Features:
- **Parallel Lower Bound**: GPU kernel for lower_bound searches across multiple threads
- **Memory Coalescing**: Optimized memory access patterns for GPU efficiency
- **Thread Cooperation**: Efficient use of GPU thread blocks and warps
- **High Throughput**: Process thousands of searches per kernel launch

GPU Implementation Details:
- Each thread processes one search query independently
- Memory coalescing optimized for sequential query patterns
- Barrier synchronization for coordinated memory access
- Compatible with CUDA and modern GPU architectures

Performance Characteristics:
- **Latency**: Higher per-query latency than CPU due to kernel launch overhead
- **Throughput**: Much higher aggregate throughput for large query batches
- **Scalability**: Performance scales with GPU core count and memory bandwidth
- **Efficiency**: Best with batch sizes >1000 queries

Usage Pattern:
    ```mojo
    # Launch GPU kernel for batch search
    ctx.enqueue_function[lower_bound_kernel](
        sorted_data_ptr, data_length,
        query_keys_ptr, num_queries,
        results_ptr, results_length,
        grid_dim=grid_size, block_dim=block_size
    )
    ```

Thread Safety and Synchronization:
- Individual threads operate independently on separate queries
- Barrier synchronization used for coordinated memory operations
- No shared state between threads except for coordinated memory access
- GPU-CPU synchronization required for result retrieval
